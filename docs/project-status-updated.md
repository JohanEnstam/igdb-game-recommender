- **Scalability**: Proven to handle 328k games on local hardware

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
```
Data Pipeline → Feature Extraction → Similarity Search → Recommendations
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
328k games → 5,262 features → Faiss Index → Real-time queries
```

### Key Components
1. **FeatureExtractor**: TF-IDF + categorical feature combination
2. **SimilaritySearch**: Faiss-based similarity search
3. **Validation Tools**: Automated testing and quality assessment
4. **Dataset Management**: Stratified sampling and full dataset handling

### Performance Metrics
- **Feature Extraction**: 43s for 328k games
- **Index Building**: 24s for 328k games
- **Query Time**: 100-200ms per recommendation
- **Memory Usage**: ~20GB peak (manageable on 32GB system)
- **Precision@10**: 0.8-1.0 across tested categories

## Data Quality Assessment

### Dataset Statistics
- **Total Games**: 328,924
- **Games with Summary**: 281,462 (85.6%)
- **Games with Genres**: 273,204 (83.1%)
- **Games with Platforms**: 261,110 (79.4%)
- **Games with Themes**: 185,625 (56.4%)
- **Quality Score Range**: 22.22 - 100.00 (Mean: 75.82)

### Validation Results
- **Strong Categories**: Puzzle, FPS, Platformer (precision 0.9-1.0)
- **Mixed Categories**: RPG, Sandbox (precision 0.8-0.9)
- **Weak Categories**: Simulation, Farming (limited data)

## Identified Issues and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Language Mixing**: Non-English games (Chinese, etc.) appear in recommendations
2. **Genre Overlap**: RPG games sometimes get Pokemon/TBS recommendations
3. **IP Clustering**: Multiple versions of same game (expansions, DLC) dominate results
4. **Search Accuracy**: Some popular games not found due to name matching issues

### Backlog Items (Future Improvements)
1. **Language Detection**: Separate indexes for EN/non-EN games
2. **Improved Name Matching**: Fuzzy matching for popular franchises
3. **Genre Weighting**: Category-specific feature weighting
4. **IP Deduplication**: Group similar games (expansions, versions)
5. **Popularity Reranking**: Hybrid content+popularity approach
6. **Negative Sampling**: Reduce weight of generic terms

## Next Steps: GCP Deployment

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Containerization**: Docker setup for feature extraction and serving
2. **Infrastructure**: GCP resources (Cloud Run, BigQuery, Storage)
3. **Orchestration**: Workflows for batch processing
4. **API Development**: RESTful API for recommendations
5. **Monitoring**: Logging and performance metrics

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Basic GCP setup with current implementation
2. **Phase 2**: Production optimization and scaling
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features (caching, monitoring, A/B testing)
