## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
```
BigQuery (24,997 games) → Feature Extraction → Cloud Storage → API (placeholder)
     ↓                        ↓                    ↓              ↓
games_with_categories → 1,949 features → 4 files → Real-time queries
```

### Key Components
1. **Cloud Run Jobs**: Feature extraction and ETL processing
2. **BigQuery**: Central data warehouse with game data
3. **Cloud Storage**: Feature storage and model artifacts
4. **Cloud Run Service**: API endpoint (needs ML integration)

### Performance Metrics
- **Feature Extraction**: 90s for 1,000 games (cloud)
- **API Response**: <2s (placeholder)
- **Data Volume**: 24,997 games in production
- **Features**: 1,949 dimensions (1,809 text + 140 categorical)
- **Storage**: 4 files in Cloud Storage

## Data Quality Assessment

### Production Dataset Statistics
- **Total Games**: 24,997 (production subset)
- **Games with Summary**: ~21,000 (84%)
- **Games with Genres**: ~20,800 (83%)
- **Games with Platforms**: ~19,800 (79%)
- **Games with Themes**: ~14,100 (56%)
- **Data Source**: Local medium dataset uploaded to BigQuery

### Feature Quality
- **Text Features**: 1,809 TF-IDF features
- **Categorical Features**: 140 one-hot encoded features
- **Combined Features**: 1,949 total dimensions
- **Feature Extraction**: Successful in cloud environment

## Current Issues and Next Steps

### Critical Issues
1. **ML Model Integration**: API uses placeholder recommendations
2. **Feature Loading**: Need to load features from Cloud Storage
3. **Similarity Search**: Faiss implementation not connected
4. **Web Frontend**: Not implemented yet

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **ML Model Integration**: Connect features to recommendations
2. **Similarity Search**: Implement Faiss in API
3. **Web Application**: Create Next.js frontend
4. **Testing**: Validate with real game IDs
5. **Performance**: Optimize response times

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: ML model integration (1-2 days)
2. **Phase 2**: Web application (2-3 days)
3. **Phase 3**: Production optimization (1 day)
